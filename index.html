    <h1>RiboDiff: detecting changes of mRNA translation efficiency from ribosome footprints</h1>
    <p>Deep sequencing based ribosome footprint profiling can provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of protein translation. However, the observed ribosome profile is fundamentally confounded by transcriptional activity. In order to decipher principles of translation regulation, tools that can reliably detect changes in translation efficiency in caseâ€“control studies are needed</p>
